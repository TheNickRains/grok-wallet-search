# grok-wallet-search
Utilizes xAI to programmatically access x_search via grok tool call. This allows developer access to X API endpoint search_all which traditionally costs 5k/mo. This workflow seeks to enrich wallet addresses by searching X for users who may have posted the address online and derive the wallets owner with a varying degree of confidence.
